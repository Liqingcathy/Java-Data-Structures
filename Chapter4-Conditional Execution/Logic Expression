//Translate each of the following English statements into logical tests that could be used in an if/else statement. 
//Write the appropriate logical test for each statement below. 
//Assume that three int variables, x, y, and z, have already been declared.


a. z is odd.	                                     z % 2 != 0
b. z is not greater than y's square root.	         z <= Math.sqrt(y)
c. y is positive.	                                 y > 0 
d. Either x or y is even,and the other is odd.     x % 2 != y % 2. (Hint: Don't use && or ||.)
e. y is a multiple of z.	                         y % z == 0
f. z is not zero.	                                 z!=0
g. y is greater in magnitude than z.	             Math.abs(y) > Math.abs(z) //magnitude 
h. x and z are of opposite signs.	                 x * z < 0 //or 
i. y is a nonnegative one-digit number.	           
j. z is nonnegative.	                             z>=0
k. x is even	                                     x % 2 = 0
l. x is closer in value to y than z is.
