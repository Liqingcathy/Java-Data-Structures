    How codes run:
    1. How many numbers? ex: 4 (input)
       
    2. Next number --> ex: 3 (input)
       (count = 1) -> count *= number ( 1 * 3 ) -> Product = 1 * 3 = 3
    3. Next number --> ex: 2 (input)
       (count = 1) -> count *= number (1 * 2) -> Product = 3 * 2 = 6
    4. Next number --> ex: 3 (input)
       (count = 1) -> count *= number (1 * 3) -> Product = 6 * 3 = 18
    5. Next number --> ex: 4 (input)
      (count = 1) -> count *= number (1 * 3) -> Product = 18 * 4 = 72
    6. Product = 72
