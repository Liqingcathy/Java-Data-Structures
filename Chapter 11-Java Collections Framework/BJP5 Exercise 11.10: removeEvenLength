/*Write a method removeEvenLength that takes a Set of strings as a parameter and that removes all of the strings of even length from the set. For example, if your method is passed a set containing the following elements:

["foo", "buzz", "bar", "fork", "bort", "spoon", "!", "dude"]
Your method should modify the set to store the following elements (the order of the elements does not matter):

["foo", "bar", "spoon", "!"]
